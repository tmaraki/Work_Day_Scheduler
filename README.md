# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Refer to this repo for commit history: https://github.com/tmaraki/mod5_attempt3
Had difficulties cloning the starter code. Repo mod5_attempt3 took the starter code and forked it. However, due to privacy restrictions on the parent branch, my Work Day Scheduler could not be published as a site. 
Approached this task by first adding the hour section for each hour of a business day in HTML. Then added today's date in javascript and coding each time block with functions if they were in the past, present or future. 
Saving and storing existing data on display and even in the local storage was the most challenging part. It was easy enough to store data into local storage, but retrieving it even after a page refresh took some time to figure out. Using JSON to parse the saved data and stringify the data helped retrieve existing information and save updated info back to the local storage.
